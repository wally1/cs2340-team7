Changelog
============================
7/16/2013
-Added command.jsp, where players can command their units to move and attack
-Modified TodoServlet to include input from command .jsp
-Modfied Player, Unit and Territory to properly update when Units move and attack
-Modified confirmation.jsp to reflect split from command .jsp
-M4 finished.

7/3/2013
-Because of the way ArrayList.contains() works, changed Player.occupiedTerritories <Territory,Integer> to <String, Integer>. This is because contains searchs for objects, and because of the way Territories are stored in each unit the game cannot recognize that two individual units can occupy the same Territory. Changed keys so that they are Territory names instead of the actual Territory
-Complete overhaul of TodoServlet, RiskGame and confirmation.jsp. Moved all of M2 placeholder code from confirmation.jsp to RiskGame.
-Properly integrated RiskGame into TodoServlet, and Confirmation into TodoServlet
-M3 finished.

6/28/2013
-Changed several ArrayList variables to TreeMaps for unique identification (Player.army, Player.occupiedTerritories, Territorry.occupiedByUnit). 
-Updated confirmation.jsp and respective classes to update change to TreeMap
-Implmented update() methods for Player and Territory, the purpose of which is to update the current state of occupiedTerritories and occupiedByUnit to reflect unit movement. Still buggy.
-M3 not yet fully implemented.
